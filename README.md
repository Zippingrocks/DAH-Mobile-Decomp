# Destroy All Humans! Mobile — Decompilation

Faithful, understandable source reconstruction of the **first Java-phone game,
version 1.2.0**, followed by a native Windows port. This is not the Xbox game,
Flash game, mobile sequel, or Crypto Does Vegas.

**Current stage: 3 of 21 original classes manually recovered locally (19 method
entries), compiled as components, and tested against the original in a documented
scope. No complete game build or native Windows port exists yet.**

## Visual progress

[**Open the visual dashboard**](docs/VISUAL_PROGRESS.md) · [Detailed source map](docs/SOURCE_TREE.md) · [Byte-match policy](docs/BYTE_MATCH.md)

![Exact-byte and normalized-match treemap](docs/BYTE_MATCH_TREEMAP.svg)

Each rectangle is an original class; its area represents the original method-entry
count. Red in recovery means not recovered. Gray in comparison means unverified,
not failure. Green exact-byte matches and blue normalized matches remain separate
from behavioral accuracy. The dashboard also contains build and behavior views.

**The first e/s/t passes are component-level.** Their tests use explicit Image
and entity-record doubles outside the rebuilt artifact; those dependencies are
not implemented game systems. No whole-class exact/normalized match is claimed,
and the global byte-match report remains unselected. Read the linked evidence
before treating a build/behavior tile as a full-game claim.

The images are generated from our recorded evidence, not hand-colored. The
`Progress dashboard` workflow refreshes them on `main` after validation; pull
requests check that generated files are current. No game binary is needed by CI.

## Source tree and progress

Open the **[source tree and implementation map](docs/SOURCE_TREE.md)** for the
actual tracked files, all 21 original classes, and separate recovery, build, and
behavior records. Planned systems are kept separate from implemented tooling.

The map is generated and checked locally:

```console
python tools/source_map.py
python tools/source_map.py --check
```

See [the maintenance guide](docs/SOURCE_MAP_GUIDE.md) before updating statuses.

## Working here

Python 3.10 or newer runs the current tools, with no third-party Python packages.
Run commands from the repository root. On Windows, `py -3` can replace `python`.

```console
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The tests use independently authored synthetic fixtures. Passing them verifies
parts of the tooling, not the complete game. Some tooling tests use an installed
JDK; actual component comparisons are a separate command with local game inputs.

For the real audit, supply your own exact input at:

```text
inputs/original/Destroy-All-Humans_J2ME_EN_v120.jar
```

That directory is ignored by Git. The tool rejects other builds by size and
SHA-256; the identity and expected counts are in `config/target.json`.

```console
python tools/dah1.py verify
python tools/dah1.py audit --output local/audit.json
```

Alternatively pass `--input "path/to/game.jar"`. An existing output file is never
overwritten; choose a new report name for each run. Auditing parses structure
without extracting or executing game code. It is not a complete JVM verifier.

For the three recovered components, restore the reviewed private source snapshots
under `src/game/`, use a JDK supporting `--release 8`, and choose a new run directory:

```console
python tools/component_recovery.py --run-dir local/component-next-run
```

This compiles a three-class component artifact and runs isolated probes. It does
not build the complete game, download a decompiler, upload game data, or compile
a native executable. See the recovery report for exact dependencies and coverage.

## Repository boundaries

- `tools/`, `tests/`: original project tooling and synthetic tests.
- `config/`: exact target identity, source-snapshot hashes and progress metadata.
- `docs/`: status, milestones, and the evidence required for a faithful release.
- `inputs/`, `local/`, `recovered/`, `src/game/`, `deps/`, `build/`: local-only,
  ignored paths. Create them as needed; they are not tracked directories.

This repository was public when initialized. Its visibility was not changed.
No original JAR, asset bundle, disassembly, recovered game source, or third-party
binary is committed. Review publication permissions and repository visibility
before tracking recovered source. No blanket license has been applied to game
material or to dependencies that have not yet been introduced.

## The next milestone

Preserve the e/s/t regression baseline, recover further dependencies, and obtain
the decompiler for a complete automated pass when tool access permits. Continue
toward a complete source-only game build without copied original classes or
placeholder gameplay. Real platform services and native compilation remain ahead.

Read [the project status](docs/STATUS.md),
[the verification contract](docs/VERIFICATION.md), and
[the workstation instructions](AGENTS.md) before changing scope or claiming progress.
